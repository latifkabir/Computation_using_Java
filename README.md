Computation using Java
======================================

Here are a few examples of Java programs.

Currently available software includes:

-   [args](args/args.html), a program which demonstrates command line
    argument retrieval.
-   [collatz](collatz/collatz.html), a program which reads an integer
    from the user and computes the Collatz sequence based on that
    integer.
-   [hello](hello/hello.html), a program which prints out "Hello,
    world!".
-   [linpack\_bench](linpack_bench/linpack_bench.html), a program which
    carries out the LINPACK benchmark.
-   [math\_intrinsics](math_intrinsics/math_intrinsics.html), a program
    which demonstrates the use of the intrinsic functions provided by
    the Math package.
-   [pnz](pnz/pnz.html), a program which plays the PNZ game.
-   [timestamp](timestamp/timestamp.html), a library which prints the
    current YMDHMS date as a timestamp;
-   [toms708](toms708/toms708.html) a library which includes routines to
    evaluate the incomplete Gamma function;\
     this is a JAVA version of ACM TOMS algorithm 708.
